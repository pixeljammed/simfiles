My pack of stepmania modcharts meant for use with [notITG](https://www.noti.tg/). All charts made by me.
May vary in quality and fun-ness. I don't own a DDR pad!



Q: Why does this exist?

A: I like rhythm games and I like Lua! I thought making these would be a fun way to practice Lua and learn about GLSL shaders. Eventually I want to progress to making levels [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqZE60HanCM)!
